                               <p>
                               It is through this bursary fund that the organization was founded. Hon. Wamusai started the bursary fund when he first became Member of county assembly for Siboti ward. It is nearly 2 years now since the kitty was started. Since its launch, the fund has benefited over 35 students, and this is a milestone in the improvement of literacy level and realization of millennium development goals. The foundation intends to cater for deserving cases countrywide.
In order to make fund self-sustaining, the foundation will launch an endowment fund where interested individuals, alumni and other organizations can support the kitty.
